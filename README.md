# SokoloffGrant

Hello! My name is Tristan and it is an honor to be teaching your kids how to program! I guess I should tell you all a little about me with all of the trust which you have put into me. I am from Phoenix, AZ (yeehaw ðŸ¤ ) and I have been in love with comptuers ever since I was little. I guess you could call it obsessed or addicted, but I like to call it fascinated. After beginnning from literally zero knowledge about programming at a very young age, I am now profficient in 6 different languages and am part of internships for my programming. Now, I want to give back to my community after all they have given to me.

This project is part of a school-sponsored grant called the Sokoloff Grant. This repository is where the students who partake in the Sokoloff Grant's class' code will be stored. This year, I applied for the Sokoloff Grant with a promise to teach the underprivileged students of the greater Phoenix area how to code, manipulate computers, and  deal with the internet safely. 

If I can promise you one thing, it is that I am going to make learning about computers and programming fun for your child. Although this program (probably) won't make your kid the next Alan Turing in a few weeks, I hope that it does put your kid on the path to become the next godfather/mother of something. Maybe not computers, but something. 

This program will teach your kid important things like how to program and what to do when you get the blue screen of death on your computer. But, that is not the most important thing that will come from the program. Those spots are held by the critical thinking skills and friendships your child will develop as part of the program.

As part of the program, your child will be recieving a laptop computer which they will be allowed to keep. This is fully subsidized by the grant. The  idea behind giving the computers away is to not only provide your child with a vehicle to continue their computer escapades after this, but also to expand access to the internet. 

It is no secret that the next generation is going to have access to types technology that we can barely dream of, and, I believe that it is crucial that we afford every child the opportunity to be the engineers of __their__ future. Therefore, ultimately, this project is meant to do just that. No child should be barred from entering into tech because of factors they cannot control.

Let's work together to create the future which ___they deserve___.

Best,
Tristan B
