You all are becoming experts at Python now. If you want a challenge, then check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HHRWg--Ce4&ab_channel=TechWithTim) video for future inspiration!

[HERE](https://ideone.com/wkZZ8D) is the code that we developed today

## Today:: __Functions__

__[here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp)__ is a very good resource for functions

Here are some examples of functions that you can make:

Function for adding two numbers and printing the result
```
def addTwoNumbers(numberOne, numberTwo):
  result = 0                      #Here is where we initialize the variable
  result = numberOne + numberTwo  #Assigning the result to the sum of the two numbers
  print(result)                   #Printing the result of the program
```

Another, shorter version of the same function
```
def addTwoNumbers(numberOne, numberTwo):
  print(numberOne + numberTwo)
```

A function for printing the string that was passed into the function
```
def printString(string):
  print(string)
```

Finally, a function that returns the difference between two values:
```
def returnDifference(numberOne, numberTwo):
  result = 0
  result = numberOne - numberTwo
  print(result)
```

#### FUN FACT: ``` print() ``` is actually a function itself!


### Work for tonight:
Try to make a function that returns the sum of three numbers!
- Must create a function for this
- The function must return the sum
