#### Topic for today: Games and Class Review!

Important bits of Information: 
- the last class will be Thursday, July 29 since some of you need to get back to school!
- I can meet with anyone who needs help individually (there are some of you who haven't done the homework yet)
- There will be a quiz next class for programming in Python!


# Games in Python!

Plan:
- Review the homework
- Go over questions that people have
- Talk about Classes a little more
- Create a rock-paper-scissors game!

As you can see, you can make any game that you want with Python!
