### Information about Scratch:
[Description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)): Scratch is a high-level block-based visual programming language 
and website targeted primarily at children 8-16 as an educational tool for coding. 
Users of the site can create projects on the web using a block-like interface.

The objective is to use code to manipulate the sprite and your project!

This is what the Sprite looks like:

2. Use atleast __one__ "if" statement in your code
