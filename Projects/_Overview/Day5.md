# Welcome to Class!
### Day 5 for up to 90 minutes
### Focus today: More funtions review and Classes if we get to it

[Here](https://sps.zoom.us/j/94771799518) is the class link

[Here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html) and [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp) are good resources for Python class information

# Arrays:
__Arrays are data structurees which can store lists of data__

### __WHY WOULD YOU WANT AN ARRAY?__
- useful for keeping things in order
- are fundamental to hashmaps and other things which can map data
- provide quick ways to iterate through a lot of data

___REMEMBER THAT AN ARRAY"S INDICES START AT 0___

##### Example:
Here is the array that I have: myArray = [10, 20, 30, 10, 0, 50, 10853]

If I want to get the number 20, I have to do this: myArray[1]


### So, if I wanted to get the object at index 6 (myArray[6]):

Remember:
Indices:  0   1   2   3   4   5     6     
Array:   [10, 20, 30, 10, 0, 50, 10853]

So the output would be 10853!

### If I wanted to do something to an entire array, remember that I can just to a for loop!

__Method 1:__
```
for i in range(len(myArray)): #remember that range gives you an array from 0 to that number and len gives you the length of the array
  #do something with myArray[i]
```

__Method 2:__
```
for thing in myArray:
  #do something with that thing
```

# Classes:
__Classes are the structures which allow for objects in programming__

Some quick facts about classes:
- This is how objects are created
- They can inherit other class' functions, methods, and data
- Classes are like a country, while the objects are the states

#### Thinking about Classes:

When something is a part of a class, you can say that "[object] is a [class]"

For example, an apple is part of the fruit class. Then you can say:

___"An APPLE is a FRUIT"___

Here is another example of a class:

### Challenge Problem/Homework!!

For next class, please try to make another function. Here is what that function needs to do:

- The function must take an array as a parameter
- the function must then iterate through every element in the array and print it out
