# Welcome to Class!
### Day 5 for up to 90 minutes
### Focus today: More funtions review and Classes if we get to it

[Here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html) and [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp) are good resources for Python class information

## Classes:
__Classes are the structures which allow for objects in programming__

Some quick facts about classes:
- This is how objects are created
- They can inherit other class' functions, methods, and data
- Classes are like a country, while the objects are the states

#### Thinking about Classes:

When something is a part of a class, you can say that "[object] is a [class]"

For example, an apple is part of the fruit class. Then you can say:

___"An APPLE is a FRUIT"___
