[Here](https://ideone.com/TmpsR9) is a fun game that I made! Please remember to send yours in!

First off, thank you all for an amazing class! It has been an honor to teach you all and I am certain that we will continue to communicate into the future!

If you need any programming, computer, or general help in the future, feel free to reach out. You all have my email.

I would certainly call this project a success and know that you all have bright futures in whatever you choose (I can certainly see some of you in tech!)

There are tentative plans to hold an ___in person___ class in the winter for building computers. Please let me know if you are interested! Anyone who attended
this class has priority in the queue for that class.

### Plan for today:
- Take the project quiz
- some quick review on how to do the project
- a lesson on internet safety
- Goodbyes!


# Solution to the Quiz:
[Finley's solution](https://ideone.com/hMgwCT) is a great example of what I was looking for! 

[Here](https://ideone.com/b1QDnj) is some of the code that I developed as a solution:

``` 
class math: 
	def __init__ (self, number1, number2):
		self.first = number1
		self.second = number2
 
 
	def getnumber(self):
		result = self.first - self.second
		print(result)
		return result
 
object = math(13, 7)
res = object.getnumber()
print("The result is: {}".format(res))
```

## AGAIN, THANK YOU ALL FOR AN AWESOME SESSION!
## HAVE A GREAT YEAR!!!
