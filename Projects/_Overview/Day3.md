# DAY 3

### More Programming today in Python

__[Here](https://ideone.com/sl3AaJ)__ is a set of solutions to the homework from last night

##### Ideas being covered:
- Review last class
- for loops
- more data types
- Everyday apps and their languages if we have time!

From feedback, I heard that I was talking too quickly last time, so we will spend some time going over last class's material today.
