### More Programming today in Python

__[HERE](https://ideone.com/CLD7lC)__ is a good set of things to know for Python
- It covers data types, for loops, while loops, variables, and classes
- this is everything that we are going to cover regarding Python this term

__[Here](https://ideone.com/sl3AaJ)__ is a set of solutions to the homework from last night


To print in Python:
```
print([what you want to print])
```
check [this](https://ideone.com/a9HiHu) example for printing in python

[Information](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp) on python loops in link and below:
- check [this](https://ideone.com/sl3AaJ) link for examples of for loops

Basic Python for Loop:
```
for [variable] in [set to be iterated]:
  [do stuff]
```

##### Ideas being covered:
- Review last class
- for loops
- more data types
- Everyday apps and their languages if we have time!

From feedback, I heard that I was talking too quickly last time, so we will spend some time going over last class's material today. 


## FOR NEXT TIME:

##### Use a for loop to print out the numbers from 1 to 100
- you must use a for loop
- make sure to email me if you have any questions
- We will do a similar project in class today
