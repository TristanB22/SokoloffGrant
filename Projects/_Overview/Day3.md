# DAY 3

### More Programming today in Python

__[HERE](https://ideone.com/CLD7lC)__ is a good set of things to know for Python

__[Here](https://ideone.com/sl3AaJ)__ is a set of solutions to the homework from last night

[Information](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp) on python loops in link and below:

```
for [variable] in [set to be iterated]:
  [do stuff]
```

##### Ideas being covered:
- Review last class
- for loops
- more data types
- Everyday apps and their languages if we have time!

From feedback, I heard that I was talking too quickly last time, so we will spend some time going over last class's material today.
